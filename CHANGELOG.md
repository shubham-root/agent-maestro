### Breaking changes

- **Roo task SSE events renamed** to follow [RooCodeEventName](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/blob/main/packages/types/src/events.ts) enum.
  - The most commonly used `message` event remains unchanged.
  - Removed events: `stream_closed`, `task_completed`, `task_aborted`, `tool_failed`, `task_created`, `error`, `task_resumed`.
- **OpenAPI path changed** from `/api/v1/openapi.json` to `/openapi.json`.

### New features

- **Anthropic-compatible endpoints** for GitHub Copilot API:
  - `POST /api/anthropic/v1/messages`
  - `POST /api/anthropic/v1/messages/count_tokens`
- **"Configure Claude Code Settings" command** for one-click setup, making Claude Code instantly usable
- `GET /api/v1/lm/tools` - lists all tools registered via `lm.registerTool()`.
- `GET /api/v1/lm/chatModels` - lists available VS Code Language Model API chat models.
- All Roo events now exposed in the Roo task/message SSE stream.
